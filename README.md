# SwiftUI
This contains two projects based on Test Tasks

Task 1
------
1. Implement table row swipe actions similar to native iOS swipes
2. Pay attention to 'primary' and secondary action behaviour
3. Use different action types and handlers in different rows
4. Use Xcode iOS SwiftUI-app template with iOS 14.5 target.

Task 2
------
1. Create a SwiftUI-app with single screen and “Hello World” Button.
2. Pressing and holding the button should play a sound file (see attachment).
3. When you release the button, playback should stop immediately.
4. The button should retain its standard iOS behaviour (color change on hold, etc.).
5. Pay attention to audio playback performance.
6. Use SwiftUI only.
7. Bonus part: place this button in List without breaking the specified behaviour.
